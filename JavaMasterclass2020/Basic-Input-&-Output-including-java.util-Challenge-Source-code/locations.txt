211,YOU ARE AT A LOW WINDOW OVERLOOKING A HUGE PIT, WHICH EXTENDS UP OUT OF SIGHT. A FLOOR IS INDISTINCTLY VISIBLE OVER 50 FEET BELOW. TRACES OF WHITE MIST COVER THE FLOOR OF THE PIT, BECOMING THICKER TO THE LEFT. MARKS IN THE DUST AROUND THE WINDOW WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT SOMEONE HAS BEEN HERE RECENTLY. DIRECTLY ACROSS THE PIT FROM YOU AND 25 FEET AWAY THERE IS A SIMILAR WINDOW LOOKING INTO A LIGHTED ROOM. A SHADOWY FIGURE CAN BE SEEN THERE PEERING BACK AT YOU.
111,A LARGE STALACTITE EXTENDS FROM THE ROOF AND ALMOST REACHES THE FLOOR BELOW. YOU COULD CLIMB DOWN IT, AND JUMP FROM IT TO THE FLOOR, BUT HAVING DONE SO YOU WOULD BE UNABLE TO REACH IT TO CLIMB BACK UP.
@11,YOU ARE IN A LITTLE MAZE OF TWISTING PASSAGES, ALL DIFFERENT.
111,YOU ARE AT THE EDGE OF A LARGE UNDERGROUND RESERVOIR. AN OPAQUE CLOUD OF WHITE MIST FILLS THE ROOM AND RISES RAPIDLY UPWARD. THE LAKE IS FED BY A STREAM, WHICH TUMBLES OUT OF A HOLE IN THE WALL ABOUT 10 FEET OVERHEAD AND SPLASHES NOISILY INTO THE WATER SOMEWHERE WITHIN THE MIST. THE ONLY PASSAGE GOES BACK TOWARD THE SOUTH.
211,DEAD END
111,YOU ARE AT THE NORTHEAST END OF AN IMMENSE ROOM, EVEN LARGER THAN THE GIANT ROOM. IT APPEARS TO BE A REPOSITORY FOR THE "ADVENTURE" PROGRAM. MASSIVE TORCHES FAR OVERHEAD BATHE THE ROOM WITH SMOKY YELLOW LIGHT. SCATTERED ABOUT YOU CAN BE SEEN A PILE OF BOTTLES (ALL OF THEM EMPTY), A NURSERY OF YOUNG BEANSTALKS MURMURING QUIETLY, A BED OF OYSTERS, A BUNDLE OF BLACK RODS WITH RUSTY STARS ON THEIR ENDS, AND A COLLECTION OF BRASS LANTERNS. OFF TO ONE SIDE A GREAT MANY DWARVES ARE SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR, SNORING LOUDLY. A SIGN NEARBY READS: "DO NOT DISTURB THE DWARVES!" AN IMMENSE MIRROR IS HANGING AGAINST ONE WALL, AND STRETCHES TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM, WHERE VARIOUS OTHER SUNDRY OBJECTS CAN BE GLIMPSED DIMLY IN THE DISTANCE.
411,YOU ARE AT THE SOUTHWEST END OF THE REPOSITORY. TO ONE SIDE IS A PIT FULL OF FIERCE GREEN SNAKES. ON THE OTHER SIDE IS A ROW OF SMALL WICKER CAGES, EACH OF WHICH CONTAINS A LITTLE SULKING BIRD. IN ONE CORNER IS A BUNDLE OF BLACK RODS WITH RUSTY MARKS ON THEIR ENDS. A LARGE NUMBER OF VELVET PILLOWS ARE SCATTERED ABOUT ON THE FLOOR. A VAST MIRROR STRETCHES OFF TO THE NORTHEAST. AT YOUR FEET IS A LARGE STEEL GRATE, NEXT TO WHICH IS A SIGN WHICH READS, "TREASURE VAULT. KEYS IN MAIN OFFICE."

141,YOU ARE IN A LONG EAST/WEST CORRIDOR. A FAINT RUMBLING NOISE CAN BE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE.
441,THE PATH FORKS HERE. THE LEFT FORK LEADS NORTHEAST. A DULL RUMBLING SEEMS TO GET LOUDER IN THAT DIRECTION. THE RIGHT FORK LEADS SOUTHEAST DOWN A GENTLE SLOPE. THE MAIN CORRIDOR ENTERS FROM THE WEST.
141,THE WALLS ARE QUITE WARM HERE. FROM THE NORTH CAN BE HEARD A STEADY ROAR, SO LOUD THAT THE ENTIRE CAVE SEEMS TO BE TREMBLING. ANOTHER PASSAGE LEADS SOUTH, AND A LOW CRAWL GOES EAST.
241,YOU ARE ON THE EDGE OF A BREATH-TAKING VIEW. FAR BELOW YOU IS AN ACTIVE VOLCANO, FROM WHICH GREAT GOUTS OF MOLTEN LAVA COME SURGING OUT, CASCADING BACK DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS. THE GLOWING ROCK FILLS THE FARTHEST REACHES OF THE CAVERN WITH A BLOOD-RED GLARE, GIVING EVERY- THING AN EERIE, MACABRE APPEARANCE. THE AIR IS FILLED WITH FLICKERING SPARKS OF ASH AND A HEAVY SMELL OF BRIMSTONE. THE WALLS ARE HOT TO THE TOUCH, AND THE THUNDERING OF THE VOLCANO DROWNS OUT ALL OTHER SOUNDS. EMBEDDED IN THE JAGGED ROOF FAR OVERHEAD ARE MYRIAD TWISTED FORMATIONS COMPOSED OF PURE WHITE ALABASTER, WHICH SCATTER THE MURKY LIGHT INTO SINISTER APPARITIONS UPON THE WALLS. TO ONE SIDE IS A DEEP GORGE, FILLED WITH A BIZARRE CHAOS OF TORTURED ROCK WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CRAFTED BY THE DEVIL HIMSELF. AN IMMENSE RIVER OF FIRE CRASHES OUT FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE VOLCANO, BURNS ITS WAY THROUGH THE GORGE, AND PLUMMETS INTO A BOTTOMLESS PIT FAR OFF TO YOUR LEFT. TO THE RIGHT, AN IMMENSE GEYSER OF BLISTERING STEAM ERUPTS CONTINUOUSLY FROM A BARREN ISLAND IN THE CENTER OF A SULFUROUS LAKE, WHICH BUBBLES OMINOUSLY. THE FAR RIGHT WALL IS AFLAME WITH AN INCANDESCENCE OF ITS OWN, WHICH LENDS AN ADDITIONAL INFERNAL SPLENDOR TO THE ALREADY HELLISH SCENE. A DARK, FOREBODING PASSAGE EXITS TO THE SOUTH.
141,YOU ARE IN A SMALL CHAMBER FILLED WITH LARGE BOULDERS. THE WALLS ARE VERY WARM, CAUSING THE AIR IN THE ROOM TO BE ALMOST STIFLING FROM THE HEAT. THE ONLY EXIT IS A CRAWL HEADING WEST, THROUGH WHICH IS COMING A LOW RUMBLING.
°41,YOU ARE WALKING ALONG A GENTLY SLOPING NORTH/SOUTH PASSAGE LINED WITH ODDLY SHAPED LIMESTONE FORMATIONS.
141,YOU ARE STANDING AT THE ENTRANCE TO A LARGE, BARREN ROOM. A SIGN POSTED ABOVE THE ENTRANCE READS: "CAUTION! BEAR IN ROOM!"
211,YOU ARE INSIDE A BARREN ROOM. THE CENTER OF THE ROOM IS COMPLETELY EMPTY EXCEPT FOR SOME DUST. MARKS IN THE DUST LEAD AWAY TOWARD THE FAR END OF THE ROOM. THE ONLY EXIT IS THE WAY YOU CAME IN.
